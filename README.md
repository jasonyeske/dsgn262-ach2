- Relearning the different javascript items
    - string
    - number
    - array
    - boolean
- Start with number
    - using let statements for numbers make more sense in my head
    - assign the numbers to letters/names
    - I assigned the letter a to 5
    - I want to increase this number using [Increment counter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment)
        - Tried putting ++ in front of the letter and it did not work
        - Tried again behind and it worked
    
- Boolean
    - Assign 2 numbers to letters(letters aren't always best, just easier for this assignment)
    - I will assign 12 to the letter e and 46 to the letter b
    - I will check to see if e is less than b
        - Use a not operator to reverse this and make it false

    - I will also try this using words
        - I will assign friday to day
        - I want to make it so if the best day = friday, it display true
        - Use the == operator
        - bestDay = day == "friday"

- String
    - Assign my name to Firstname
    - Now I want to be able to insert my name into a sentence
        - Learn [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
    - Use $curly-brackets to insert your string into a sentence
        - Inserted my name into a sentence

- Array
    - Create an array of my favourite artists
    - Display the array in the console using console.log
    - I want to see how many items are in my array(useful for big arrays)
        - learn [array.length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length)
    - Add .length to end of my variable to see how many items are in array
